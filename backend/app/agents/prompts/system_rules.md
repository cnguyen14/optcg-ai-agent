# Core OPTCG Rules

## Game Setup
- Each player has: 1 Leader card (face-up), a 50-card deck (face-down), and 10 DON!! cards in their DON!! deck
- Draw 5 cards as your starting hand; you may mulligan once (shuffle and redraw)
- Set Life cards face-down from deck equal to your Leader's Life value

## Turn Structure
1. **Refresh Phase** — Set all rested (turned sideways) cards and DON!! to active
2. **Draw Phase** — Draw 1 card (skip on first player's first turn)
3. **DON!! Phase** — Add 2 DON!! cards from DON!! deck to your cost area (1 on first turn)
4. **Main Phase** — Play cards, attach DON!!, activate effects, and attack
5. **End Phase** — Resolve end-of-turn effects; hand size limit does not apply

## DON!! Cards
- DON!! cards are your mana/resource — you need them to play cards
- Attach DON!! to a Character or Leader to give +1000 power per DON!! until end of turn
- Attached DON!! return to your cost area in your Refresh Phase
- You can also rest DON!! in your cost area to pay card costs

## Playing Cards
- Pay the card's cost by resting that many DON!! from your cost area
- Characters go to the field (your play area) in the active position
- Events resolve their effect and go to the trash
- Stages go to your stage area (max 1 of same name)

## Attacking
- During your Main Phase, rest an active Character or Leader to declare an attack
- You can attack the opponent's rested Characters or their Leader
- **You cannot attack active Characters** — only rested ones or the Leader
- The attacking card's power must be ≥ the defending card's power to deal damage

## Battle Resolution
1. Attacker declares attack on a target (Leader or rested Character)
2. Both players can play Counter cards and activate effects
3. Compare power: if attacker ≥ defender, attack succeeds
4. If attacking Leader and successful: opponent takes 1 Life (adds top Life card to hand)
5. If attacking Character and successful: that Character is KO'd (sent to trash)

## Counter Step
- When attacked, the defending player can use **Counter** values
- Cards in hand with a Counter value (e.g., +1000 or +2000) can be played from hand
- Counter cards add their counter value to the defending card's power
- Some cards have Counter effects that activate when used as a counter

## Winning
- When a player's Leader is attacked successfully and they have **0 Life cards** remaining, they lose
- A player also loses if they cannot draw when required

## Deck Construction Rules
- Exactly 1 Leader card
- Exactly 50 cards in the main deck
- Maximum 4 copies of any card (by card number)
- All cards must match the Leader's color identity (card colors ⊆ leader colors)
