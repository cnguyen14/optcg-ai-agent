# One Piece Card Game — Keywords & Abilities Reference

## Combat Keywords

### Blocker
**Effect**: When your opponent attacks, you may rest this card to redirect the attack to this card instead.
**Rules**:
- Can only be used if the Blocker card is in the active (upright) position
- The Blocker becomes the new target of the attack
- The Blocker becomes rested when used
- Multiple Blockers cannot block the same attack — only one can redirect
- Works against attacks on your Leader OR your rested Characters

### Rush
**Effect**: This card can attack on the same turn it is played.
**Rules**:
- Normally, Characters cannot attack the turn they are played (summoning sickness)
- Rush bypasses this restriction
- The card still needs to be rested (turned sideways) to attack

### Double Attack
**Effect**: When this card's attack on the opponent's Leader is successful, the opponent takes 2 Life damage instead of 1.
**Rules**:
- Only works when attacking the opponent's **Leader** (not Characters)
- The opponent moves 2 cards from Life to hand instead of 1
- Both Life cards can trigger their Trigger effects
- If the opponent has only 1 Life card, they take that 1 damage and then lose if attacked again

### Banish
**Effect**: When this card's attack on the opponent's Leader is successful, the Life card removed is placed in the trash instead of the opponent's hand.
**Rules**:
- The opponent does NOT add the Life card to their hand
- The Life card goes directly to trash face-up
- Trigger effects on the banished Life card do NOT activate
- Extremely powerful as it prevents the opponent from gaining resources

## Timing Keywords

### [On Play]
Activates when the card enters the field from hand by paying its cost.
Does NOT activate if the card is placed by another effect (unless stated otherwise).

### [When Attacking]
Activates when this card is declared as an attacker (when it is rested to attack).
Resolves before the Counter Step.

### [On K.O.]
Activates when this card is KO'd (destroyed in battle or by an effect).
The effect resolves while the card is being sent to trash.

### [End of Your Turn]
Activates during the End Phase of the card controller's turn.

### [On Your Opponent's Attack]
Activates when the opponent declares any attack (not just attacks on this card).

### [Activate: Main]
An activated ability that can be used during your Main Phase.
Usually has a cost or condition.
Most are limited to once per turn unless stated otherwise.

### [Trigger]
When this card is moved from Life to hand as the result of taking damage, you may activate this effect without paying its cost. If it's a Character with Trigger, you can play it for free.

### [Counter]
Activated when your opponent's attack is declared and you use this card from hand.
The card goes to trash after using its Counter effect.

### DON!! x[N]
This effect is active only when this card has N or more DON!! cards attached to it.
Example: "DON!! x2" means the effect works when 2+ DON!! are attached.

## Resource Keywords

### [Once Per Turn]

Resets at the start of your next turn.

### [Twice Per Turn]

## Effect Keywords

### Trash
To "trash" a card means to place it in the trash zone (discard pile).
Cards in trash are public information and can be viewed by both players.

### Rest
To "rest" a card means to turn it sideways.
Rested cards cannot attack or use Blocker until refreshed.

### Active
An "active" card is in the upright position.
Only active cards can attack or use Blocker.

### K.O.
"K.O." (Knock Out) means to remove a Character from the field and place it in the trash.
Leaders cannot be K.O.'d.

### Bottom of Deck
Some effects place cards at the bottom of the owner's deck.
This removes the card from the current zone without it going to trash.

### Return to Hand (Bounce)
An effect that returns a card from the field to its owner's hand.
This is not considered KO'ing the card, so [On K.O.] effects do not trigger.

### Look at / Reveal
"Look at" lets only the specified player see the card(s).
"Reveal" shows the card(s) to all players.

### Search Deck
Some effects let you search your deck for a card meeting certain conditions.
